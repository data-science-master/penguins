The Palmer Archipelago Penguins Data is a really cool alternative to the famous iris data. Not only does the penguins data **not** come from a eugenics journal, but it also includes interesting features for education, like a satisfying way to demonstrate simple classifiers, and a nice demonstration of Simpson's paradox (if you look at the association between bill depth and flipper length, e.g.).

I made a pairs plot for the penguins data, and here it is:

  ![](../output/penguin_pairs.png)\ 
  
When I ran a simple random forest classifier using just the bill measurements with 100 trees in the ensemble, I estimated that this classifier has a general accuracy of the following:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
read_csv("../output/penguin_class.csv") %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

I hope you enjoyed this report!
